  Get up and running with large language models.

  Ollama is an inference engine for large language models.
  This charm is suitable for developers and organizations looking to harness the power of large language models in their applications without the complexity of manual setup and configuration.

  Ollama exposes an HTTP API with the same format as OpenAI, enabling rapid migration of your application from closed-source models like OpenAI's to open-source models like Llama and Mistral.
